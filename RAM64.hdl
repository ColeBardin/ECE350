    /* Implementation tip: A larger RAM unit can be built by grouping smaller RAM-parts together.
       Think about the RAMâ€™s address input as consisting of two fields: 
       one field can be used to select a RAM-part;
       the other field can be used to select a register within that RAM-part
       Use mux/demux logic to effect this addressing scheme.
